% Each contains a single chapter, they include all the settings defined in this .tex file
% Allows easier moving around of chapters

% Use \include{<path to .tex file>} to include documents
% For example
%\include{Chapter_1/Chapter_1}


% Rename Bibliography to References
\renewcommand\bibname{References}
%\bibliography{<Path to .bib file>}
