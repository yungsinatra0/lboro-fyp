% Abstract
\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
This project addresses a key issue in Moldova's healthcare sector: the fragmentation of patient data across multiple healthcare institutions. The lack of a nationally-wide integrated system has resulted in overreliance of paper-based and manual processes, leading to reduced patient care quality and incomplete medical histories. Following initial stakeholder consultations and a review of the relevant literature, the project proposed a patient-focused prototype  that allowed users to collect and manage their patient data. The solution enables document uploading and record creation, automated lab result extraction with multimodal large language models and a controlled sharing mechanism with healthcare practitioners. The prototype was implemented using a Vue frontend and FastAPI backend as a web application that demonstrates the feasibility of a patient-focused solution in Moldova's healthcare sector. Stakeholder feedback was collected throughout the whole development process through a series of live demonstrations, allowing for iterative improvements to the application. Final stakeholder feedback confirms the application's potential to enhance care quality and introduce a patient-centric approach to healthcare in Moldova. Overall, this project aims to contribute to Moldova's digital healthcare transformation and hopes to serve as a foundation for future development and implementation of a real-world service.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my gratitude to my project supervisor, Dr.\ Georgina Cosma, for her invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. Her feedback and encouragement have been crucial in motivating and encouraging me to continue exploring and innovating in my system design and development.

I am also deeply grateful to all the stakeholders who have generously contributed their time and ideas to this project. Their insights into the workings of Moldova's healthcare sector and the digital landscape of healthcare technology have been invaluable in shaping the direction of this project. Their feedback and suggestions have been instrumental in refining the system design and ensuring that it meets the needs of its users and improves the quality of care provided to patients. This ultimately ensured that this project efficiently addresses the real-world challenges faced by the healthcare sector in Moldova.

Next, I would like to extend my appreciation to the Loughborough University staff and faculty who provided all the necessary knowledge and support throughout my studies. This project represents a culmination of everything I have learned during my degree, and I am grateful for the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in a practical setting.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends, who have always been encouraging me during this project. Their belief in my abilities and support have been a source of motivation and inspiration.

I'd like to dedicate this project to my late grandfather, who was a well-known doctor in Moldova. His devotion to this field and commitment to saving patient lives have always been a source of inspiration for our family. Even though I'm not pursuing a career in medicine, I hope to honour his legacy by contributing to the improvement of healthcare in Moldova through this project. I hope that my work will help to create a better healthcare system for future generations, just as he did for his patients.
