abstract = {This history column article provides a tour of the main software development life cycle (SDLC) models. (A lifecycle covers all the stages of software from its inception with requirements definition through to fielding and maintenance.) System development lifecycle models have drawn heavily on software and so the two terms can be used interchangeably in terms of SDLC, especially since software development in this respect encompasses software systems development. Because the merits of selecting and using an SDLC vary according to the environment in which software is developed as well as its application, I discuss three broad categories for consideration when analyzing the relative merits of SDLC models. I consider the waterfall model before the other models because it has had a profound effect on software development, and has additionally influenced many SDLC models prevalent today. Thereafter, I consider some of the mainstream models and finish with a discussion of what the future could hold for SDLC models.},

abstract={The software development process needs specific and studied steps within a reliable plan to achieve the requirements for the success of any project.Software development life cycle (SDLC) methodologies have provided several models that meet the needs of the various proposed projects. These methodologies present various scenarios that can be applied in the process of developing systems to make them more efficient and predictive. The paper aims to illuminate the paramount Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodologies by conducting a comprehensive review of the pros and cons of the various models widely used for software design. Furthermore, the paper discusses fundamental trajectories that are shaping the future landscape of SDLC methodologies. This review included two main types of software development life cycle approaches such as traditional SDLC (heavy-weight) and agile SDLC (light-weight) approaches. The traditional approach included several models such as the Waterfall model, Iterative model, Spiral model, V-Model, and Big Bang Model. Whereas, the agile approach included various models such as the eXtreme Programming (XP) Model, scrum Model, Feature Driven Development (FDD) Model, and Kanban Model. A comprehensive analytical study of all software development life cycle models was achieved and highlighted their most prominent strengths and weaknesses of them. SDLC methodologies wield substantial ramifications across a multitude of sectors, contingent upon several models tailored to individual developmental and research contexts. In culmination, the paper furnishes an all-encompassing perspective on paramount SDLC models, encompassing two principal paradigms: the traditional and the agile approaches. These encompass fundamental sub-models that encapsulate pioneering models poised for application in system development, thus facilitating their refinement more efficiently and predictably.},

abstract = {Three project management approaches—traditional, agile, and hybrid—were considered in this study. Results from an international study, including 477 cross-industry projects, indicated that 52\% of projects could be categorized as hybrid approaches. A regression analysis using multiple outcome measures indicated substantial explanatory power (0.21 < R 2 <0.41). Analysis suggested that hybrid and agile approaches significantly increase stakeholder success over traditional approaches while achieving the same budget, time, scope, and quality outcomes. Hybrid approaches were found to be similar in effectiveness to fully agile approaches. Results validate decisions by practitioners to combine agile and traditional practices and suggest that hybrid is a leading project management approach.}

abstract = {Abstract Software requirement engineering (SRE) is the initial stage of the software engineering process and entails several challenges relating to the identification, implementation, evolution, and management of requirements for the development of software systems that meet the desired functionality quality standards. Agile software development (ASD) is a well-known software development process that follows a lightweight and adaptive methodology to support the incremental development of software systems. Since the ASD follows an adaptive procedure (ie, a flexible, nanostructured, and dynamic approach) of software development, it becomes challenging to perform SRE that follows a structured approach for managing software requirements throughout the life cycle of software development. The primary challenges for SRE, while pursuing an ASD, include, but are not limited to, identification of incomplete requirements, implementation of vague requirements, prioritization of secondary functional requirements, and compromise on users' involvement that negatively impacts the software system's functionality and quality. To overcome these challenges, some of the recent research efforts have focused on managing different phases of SRE during software development using the ASD. However, there is a lack of solutions that provide software engineers/practitioners with a solution. Besides, frameworks to effectively manage all the phases of SRE as per the needs of the ASD are needed. We propose a framework that unifies joint requirements document (JRD) and SCRUM to incrementally (a) identify, (b) implement, (c) evolve, and (d) manage system requirements throughout the software development cycle. We have used the action research method to qualitatively validate the proposed framework based on data and user requirements collected from a product-focused (multinational) Norway-based software company. The results of the validation are based on statistical analysis that reflects the usefulness of the proposed framework for SRE in ASD-based software engineering and development. Future research is the possible application of a machine learning approach (es) in the intended context for agile requirements elicitations.},

  abstract = "{Designers often gather information, for instance through stakeholder or domain expert meetings, to understand their design problems and develop effective solutions. However, few previous studies have provided in-depth descriptions of novice engineering designers’ approaches to conducting information gathering meetings. In this preliminary study, we analyzed data from six capstone mechanical engineering design teams to identify the types of individuals from whom teams gathered information, when these meetings occurred, and how teams solicited information during meetings. Teams in our study exhibited a range of information gathering behaviors that aligned with recommended practices, particularly in their early meetings. We also observed relatively few instances of teams exhibiting behaviors that were less similar to recommended practices during their meetings. However, our findings revealed two key trends across teams that represented specific opportunities for improvement and that may reflect characteristic novice approaches to conducting information gathering meetings. First, teams explored domain experts’ perspectives in depth during meetings and met with additional domain experts to inform their projects. Teams' meetings with project partners contained few instances of deep exploratory information gathering behaviors in comparison. In addition, teams seemed to finalize design decisions during early design meetings and were less likely to conduct information gathering meetings during later design phases. The comprehensive descriptions of novice mechanical engineering designers’ approaches provided in our preliminary study provide an entry point for further investigations that can inform engineering training, tools, and pedagogy for conducting effective meetings.}",

ABSTRACT = {The deployment of large language models (LLMs) within the healthcare sector has sparked both enthusiasm and apprehension. These models exhibit the remarkable ability to provide proficient responses to free-text queries, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of professional medical knowledge. This comprehensive survey delves into the functionalities of existing LLMs designed for healthcare applications and elucidates the trajectory of their development, starting with traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and then moving to the present state of LLMs in the healthcare sector. First, we explore the potential of LLMs to amplify the efficiency and effectiveness of diverse healthcare applications, particularly focusing on clinical language understanding tasks. These tasks encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from named entity recognition and relation extraction to natural language inference, multimodal medical applications, document classification, and question-answering. Additionally, we conduct an extensive comparison of the most recent state-of-the-art LLMs in the healthcare domain, while also assessing the utilization of various open-source LLMs and highlighting their significance in healthcare applications. Furthermore, we present the essential performance metrics employed to evaluate LLMs in the biomedical domain, shedding light on their effectiveness and limitations. Finally, we summarize the prominent challenges and constraints faced by large language models in the healthcare sector by offering a holistic perspective on their potential benefits and shortcomings. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the current landscape of LLMs in healthcare, addressing their role in transforming medical applications and the areas that warrant further research and development.},
