\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Areas of Improvement}

% Talk about the need for better error handling and logging in the system
% Talk about the need for better documentation and user guides for the system
% Talk about the need for better testing and validation of the system
% Talk about the need for better security and privacy measures in the system (HTTPS, encryption at rest, better authentication method)
% Talk about the need for better performance and scalability of the system (more efficient)
% Talk about the need for better user experience and user interface design in the system
% Patients giving their consent to have their data processed and stored by the system/AI & other legal stuff
% Talk about having a way to log changes to the system

\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future_work}

% Talk about integration with Mpass
% Talk about AI LLM integration that can automatically pre-fill forms and the human can just review and submit
% Talk about changing storage to more secure storage ex AWS S3 or other cloud storage
% Talk about using better authentication methods
% Talk about using local MLLMs
% Talk about giving doctors the ability to add notes and comments/create medical history entries for patients.
% Talk about medication tracking for medications

\section{Lessons Learned and Reflections}

% Talk about the agility of the development process and how it was easy to iterate on the design and implementation of the system
% Talk about how hard it is to manage a project and develop at the same time - the importance of roles like project/product manager, business analyst, qa engineer, etc. 
% Talk about how Agile has little documentation and how I've experienced that myself due to often changes requested by stakeholders in the project
% Talk about how documents are 'alive' and how they often change throughout the project - the ones I created during project planning were usually very different when development was actually done
% How important it is to properly manage the time and resources of the project and how I learned that the hard way
