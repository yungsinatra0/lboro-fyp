\section{Project Management Methodology and Tooling}

Based on the research above, the student has decided that he will be using a hybrid approach, with Waterfall as the main methodology for planning managing the project. The development part of the project will be done using ScrumBan, so that the student will be able to utilise elements from both frameworks. There are several reasons for this choice:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The nature of the project - the student is working on a project that has a limited timeframe (about 6-7 months) and is of a smaller scale. 
    \item Documentation requirements - the student is required to document the progress during the project in this report, including the requirements gathered, design considerations and implementation decisions and outcomes. 
    \item Regulatory requirements - the student is required to adhere to the regulations and standards of the healthcare industry, which may require extensive documentation and planning.
    \item Customer involvement - the student will be working closely with the project stakeholder, who will be providing feedback and guidance throughout the project.
    \item Familiarity with both Agile and Waterfall - the student has experience with both Agile (specifically Scrum and Kanban) and Waterfall methodologies, and has worked on projects that have used both approaches.
\end{enumerate}

The student will use Jira Software as their project management tool, which is one of the most popular project management tool for software development projects that supports working with Agile frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban \parencite{atlassian}.
