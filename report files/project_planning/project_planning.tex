\chapter{Project Planning and Design}

\section{Project Management Methodology and Tooling}

Based on the research above, the student has decided that he will be using a hybrid approach, with Waterfall as the main methodology for planning managing the project. The development part of the project will be done using ScrumBan, so that the student will be able to utilise elements from both frameworks. There are several reasons for this choice:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The nature of the project - the student is working on a project that has a limited timeframe (about 6-7 months) and is of a smaller scale. 
    \item Documentation requirements - the student is required to document the progress during the project in this report, including the requirements gathered, design considerations and implementation decisions and outcomes. 
    \item Regulatory requirements - the student is required to adhere to the regulations and standards of the healthcare industry, which may require extensive documentation and planning.
    \item Customer involvement - the student will be working closely with the project stakeholder, who will be providing feedback and guidance throughout the project.
    \item Familiarity with both Agile and Waterfall - the student has experience with both Agile (specifically Scrum and Kanban) and Waterfall methodologies, and has worked on projects that have used both approaches.
\end{enumerate}

The student will use Jira Software as their project management tool, which is one of the most popular project management tool for software development projects that supports working with Agile frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban \parencite{atlassian}.

\section{Requirements and Stakeholder Analysis}

\subsection{Stakeholder Analysis}

To gain a more complete understanding of the current situation and the needs of the stakeholders, the student has conducted a stakeholder analysis. The student has identified the following stakeholders:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A doctor working at the Republican Hospital - the main stakeholder, who will be providing guidance and feedback throughout the project on the perspective of the end users, the doctors and nurses who will be using the EHR system.
    \item The Vice-Director of CNAM (National Health Insurance Company) - the person who will be providing feedback from the perspective of the health insurance company.
    \item Senior IT staff member at CNAM - a person who also has previously worked within the Ministry of Health, and who will be providing feedback on the technical aspects of the integration between the EHR system and the health insurance system.
    \item Department head at the Republican Hospital - a person who will be providing feedback on the administrative aspects of the EHR system.
    \item Patients - while they are not directly involved in the project, the EHR system will have a direct impact on them, as it will help improve the quality of care they receive.
\end{enumerate}

These stakeholders have been identified so that they can provide a bigger picture on the needs and requirements of the project, and to ensure that the project is aligned with the needs of the healthcare industry in Moldova. 

The stakeholders have also been placed the stakeholder influence-interest grid, to help the student understand the level of influence and interest that each stakeholder has in the project:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The doctor working at the Republican Hospital - low influence, high interest
    \item The Vice-Director of CNAM - high influence, high interest
    \item Senior IT staff member at CNAM - high influence, low interest
    \item Department head at the Republican Hospital - high influence, high interest
    \item Patient - low influence, low interest
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements}

Following the stakeholder analysis, the student has conducted several interviews with the key stakeholders to gather the requirements for the project. The student has identified the following requirements, which are prioritized using the MoSCoW method. The requirements have been categorized in various sections based on the area of the system they are related to. 

At the moment, the requirements are kept at a high level, and will be further refined when they will be moved to the product backlog and then individually during their respective Sprints.

\subsubsection{Accessibility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must be accessible using any desktop-based web browser
    \item The system must be accessible from any location, as long as the user has an internet connection
    \item The system should be accessible on mobile devices using a web browser
    \item The system could allow doctors to access test results and vitals using a mobile web browser
    \item The system could allow doctors to create basic daily record entries using a mobile web browser
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must have an audit log that records all changes made to the patient records by the system users
    \item The system must have role-based access control, with different roles for doctors, nurses, and administrative staff
    \item The system must restrict edit access to patient records for other doctors and nurses, except for the doctor who is assigned to the patient
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vitals and test results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must allow doctors to view the history of the hospitalized patient's test results in a graphical and numerical format
    \item The system must allow doctors to view the history of the hospitalized patient's vitals in a graphical and numerical format
    \item The system must load the patient's vitals and test results within 3 seconds of the doctor opening the patient's record
    \item The system must allow doctors to order lab tests for the patient
    \item The system should allow doctors to export the patient's test results and vitals in Excel format
    \item The system could allow doctors to generate a barcode to be printed and attached to the patient's sample
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Prescriptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must allow doctors to order medications
    \item The system must allow allow doctors to assign medications to the hospitalized patient
    \item The system must allow doctors and nurses to track the assigned hospitalized patient's medication intake
    \item The system should allow doctors to specify the dosage, frequency, duration and method of administration of the medication
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Patient records}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must allow doctors to view the patient's previous hospital records
    \item The system must allow doctors to create hospitalization-related records for the patient: admission, discharge, transfer, death
    \item The system must allow doctors to create daily record entries for the hospitalized patient
    \item The system could allow doctors to manually upload patient records from paper-based records

    \item The system must allow doctors to change the patient's diagnosis after the patient has been discharged
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Administration}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must communicate with ASP system to extract patient personal data using IDNP at the time of patient registration
    \item The system must allow administrative staff to register new patients
